# This NetworkPolicy allows traffic from the cache Prometheus to the node-exporter pods running in `kube-system`
# namespace. Note that it is only applicable/relevant in case the seed cluster is a shoot cluster itself (otherwise,
# there won't be a running node-exporter (typically)).
# The gardener-resource-manager's NetworkPolicy controller is not enabled for the kube-system namespace, hence we need
# to create this custom policy for this network path.
