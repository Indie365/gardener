description: 'APIServerAuditWebhookBackend contains configuration for the webhook
  audit backend for the Gardener API server. The webhook audit backend sends audit
  events to a remote web API, which is assumed to be a form of the Kubernetes API,
  including means of authentication. For more information, please see here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#webhook-backend'
properties:
  InitialBackoff:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.Duration.yaml
    description: InitialBackoff specifies the amount of time to wait after the first
      failed request before retrying. Subsequent requests are retried with exponential
      backoff.
  batchBufferSize:
    description: BatchBufferSize is the size of the buffer to store events before
      batching and writing. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  batchMaxSize:
    description: BatchMaxSize is the maximum size of a batch. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  batchMaxWait:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.Duration.yaml
    description: BatchMaxWait is the amount of time to wait before force writing the
      batch that hadn't reached the max size. Only used in batch mode.
  batchThrottleBurst:
    description: BatchThrottleBurst is the maximum number of requests sent at the
      same moment if ThrottleQPS was not utilized before. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  batchThrottleEnable:
    description: 'BatchThrottleEnable defines whether batching throttling is enabled.
      Only used in batch mode. Default: true'
    type: boolean
  batchThrottleQPS:
    description: BatchThrottleQPS is the maximum average number of batches per second.
      Only used in batch mode.
    format: float
    type: number
  kubeconfig:
    $ref: blueprint://schema/com.github.gardener.landscaper.apis.core.v1alpha1.Target.yaml
    default: {}
    description: Kubeconfig is the kubeconfig for the external audit log backend
  mode:
    description: Mode is the strategy for sending audit events. Blocking indicates
      sending events should block server responses. Batch causes the backend to buffer
      and write events asynchronously. Known modes are batch,blocking,blocking-strict.
    type: string
  truncateEnabled:
    description: TruncateEnabled configures whether event and batch truncating is
      enabled.
    type: boolean
  truncateMaxBatchSize:
    description: TruncateMaxBatchSize is the maximum size of the batch sent to the
      underlying backend. If a batch exceeds this limit, it is split into several
      batches of smaller size. Actual serialized size can be several hundreds of bytes
      greater. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  truncateMaxEventSize:
    description: TruncateMaxEventSize is the maximum size of the audit event sent
      to the underlying backend. If the size of an event is greater than this number,
      first request and response are removed, and if this doesn't reduce the size
      enough, event is discarded.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  version:
    description: Version is the API group and version used for serializing audit events
      written to log.
