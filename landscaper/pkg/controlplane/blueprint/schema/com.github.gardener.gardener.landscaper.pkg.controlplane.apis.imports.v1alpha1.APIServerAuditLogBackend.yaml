    description: BatchMaxWait is the amount of time to wait before force writing the
      batch that hadn't reached the max size. Only used in batch mode.
  batchThrottleBurst:
    description: BatchThrottleBurst is the maximum number of requests sent at the
      same moment if ThrottleQPS was not utilized before. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer

    description: 'BatchThrottleEnable defines whether batching throttling is enabled.
      Only used in batch mode. Default: true'
    type: boolean
  batchThrottleQPS:
    description: BatchThrottleQPS is the maximum average number of batches per second.
      Only used in batch mode.
    format: float
    type: number
  format:
    description: Format of saved audits. "legacy" indicates 1-line text format for
      each event. "json" indicates structured json format.
    type: string
  maxAgema:
    description: MaxAge is the maximum number of days to retain old audit log files
      based on the timestamp encoded in their filename.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  maxBackup:
    description: 'MaxBackup is the maximum number of old audit log files to retain.
      Default: 5'
    format: int32
    type: integer
  maxSize:
    description: 'MaxSize is the maximum size in megabytes of the audit log file before
      it gets rotated. Default: 100'
    format: int32
    type: integer
  mode:
    description: Mode is the strategy for sending audit events. Blocking indicates
      sending events should block server responses. Batch causes the backend to buffer
      and write events asynchronously. Known modes are batch,blocking,blocking-strict.
    type: string
  path:
    description: 'Path is the path that if set, contains the audit logs of all requests
      coming to the API server. ''-'' means standard out. Default: /var/lib/audit.log'
    type: string
  truncateEnabled:
    description: TruncateEnabled configures whether event and batch truncating is
      enabled.
    type: boolean
  truncateMaxBatchSize:
    description: TruncateMaxBatchSize is the maximum size of the batch sent to the
      underlying backend. If a batch exceeds this limit, it is split into several
      batches of smaller size. Actual serialized size can be several hundreds of bytes
      greater. Only used in batch mode.
    format: int32
    type: integer
  truncateMaxEventSize:
    description: TruncateMaxEventSize is the maximum size of the audit event sent
      to the underlying backend. If the size of an event is greater than this number,
      first request and response are removed, and if this doesn't reduce the size
      enough, event is discarded.

    type: integer
  version:
    description: Version is the API group and version used for serializing audit events
      written to log.
