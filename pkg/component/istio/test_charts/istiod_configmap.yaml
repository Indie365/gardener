    # Automatic protocol detection uses a set of heuristics to
    # determine whether the connection is using TLS or not (on the
    # server side), as well as the application protocol being used
    # (e.g., http vs tcp). These heuristics rely on the client sending
    # the first bits of data. For server first protocols like MySQL,
    # MongoDB, etc., Envoy will timeout on the protocol detection after
    # the specified period, defaulting to non mTLS plain TCP
    # traffic. Set this field to tweak the period that Envoy will wait
    # for the client to send the first bits of data. 
    # (MUST BE >=1ms or 0s to disable). Default detection timeout is 0s (no timeout).
