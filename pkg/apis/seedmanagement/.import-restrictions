# The seedmanagement API is special, because it imports the gardenlet config API for its defaulting and conversion.
# This is kind of undesirable for other projects importing the seedmanagement API, as it pulls in many other unwanted
# dependencies (e.g. client-go, controller-runtime). This will more or less force other projects to use the same version
# of these dependencies when importing the seedmanagement API.
# However, we can't really avoid it until we have a proper sync out mechanism like k/k, which filters
# out defaulting and conversion code.
# TODO: eliminate these drawbacks
