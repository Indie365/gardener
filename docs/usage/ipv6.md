## IPv6 Single-Stack Networking

[GEP-21](../proposals/21-ipv6-singlestack-local.md) proposes IPv6 Single-Stack Support in the local Gardener environment.
This documentation will be enhanced while implementing GEP-21, see [gardener/gardener#7051](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/7051).

To use IPv6 single-stack networking, the [feature gate](../deployment/feature_gates.md) `IPv6SingleStack` must be enabled on gardener-apiserver.
