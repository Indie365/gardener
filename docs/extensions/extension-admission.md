# Extension Admission

The extensions are expected to validate their respective resources for their extension specific configurations, when the resources are newly created or updated. As a best practice, the validation should be performed only if there is a change in the `spec` of the resource. Please find an exemplary implementation [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-aws/tree/master/pkg/admission/validator).

When a resource is newly created or updated, Gardener adds an extension label for all the extension types referenced in the `spec` of the resource. This label is of the form `<extension-type>.extensions.gardener.cloud/<extension-name> : "true"`. For example, an extension label for provider extension type `aws`, looks like `provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/aws : "true"`. The extensions should add object selectors in their admission webhooks for these labels, to filter out the objects they are responsible for.
At present, these labels are added to `BackupEntry`s, `BackupBucket`s, `CloudProfile`s, `Seed`s, and `Shoot`s. 
Please see [this](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/pkg/apis/core/v1beta1/constants/types_constants.go) for the full list of extension labels.
